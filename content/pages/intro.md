Title: Introduction
Date: 2013-10-17

I'm a graduate student in computer security, so I read lots and lots
of papers.

After I read the papers, they go into piles on my desk, and after a
week or so I don't remember which paper was which, anymore.  This will
not do.

From now on, I will be writing a brief review of each paper as I read
it, and until the heap is slain, I will reread one or two papers every
weekday and post reviews here. You can expect lots of material from
the [Free Haven Anonymity Bibliography](http://freehaven.net/anonbib/),
but I've never been able to stick to just one subfield, and I don't
plan to start now. Sometimes I may even wander outside of security
altogether.
